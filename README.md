# 2025-HUDS-Bootcamp
#### The 2025 Howard University Data Science for Social Impact Bootcamp was an opportunity for me to explore how data science can be used to drive meaningful change. This repository documents my personal journey through the program, showcasing the code I developed to examine critical social issues. Each project in this repository reflects topics I am passionate about and committed to understanding more deeply. My goal throughout the bootcamp has been to use data not just to find answers, but to fuel action and advocacy. I am incredibly grateful to Howard University, the bootcamp faculty, and my peers for fostering a collaborative and inspiring learning environmentâ€”one where technology is used in the service of justice. This project uses Python.
